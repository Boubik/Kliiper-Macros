# Klipper-Macros
This repository contains a collection of macros for [Klipper], a 3D printer firmware that runs on a Raspberry Pi and controls the printer via USB. Klipper allows you to define custom G-code commands and scripts that can be executed from the printerâ€™s LCD menu, web interface, or slicer.

# Installation
