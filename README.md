# Klipper-Settings
This repository contains a collection of setting for Klipper, a 3D printer firmware that runs on a Raspberry Pi and controls the printer via USB. Klipper allows you to define custom G-code commands and scripts that can be executed from the printerâ€™s LCD menu, web interface, or slicer.

# Installation
To use these macros, you need to have Klipper installed and configured on your Raspberry Pi and 3D printer. You can follow the official installation guide.
- Add this repository as a git submodule to your klipper_config folder on your Raspberry Pi by running the following commands:
  ```terminal
  cd ~/
  git clone https://github.com/Boubik/Kliiper-Settings.git Boubik-Settings
  ln -s ~/Boubik-Settings/configs printer_data/config/Boubik-Settings
  cp ~/Boubik-Settings/Boubik-Settings.cfg ~/printer_data/config/Boubik-Settings.cfg
